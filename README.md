Learning Machine Learning

To someone unfamiliar with the topic, Machine Learning sounds like a course meant for humans to learn about machines. 
Its the opposite.

What i have experimented with so far:

Supervised Learning:

    Linear Regression
  
    Logistic Regression
  
    K-Nearest Neighbors
  
     Neural Networks
  
  
Unsupervised Learning:

    K-Means Clustering
  
    Principle Component Analysis

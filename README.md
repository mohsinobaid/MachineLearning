Learning Machine Learning

To someone unfamiliar with the topic, Machine Learning sounds like a course meant for humans to learn about machines. 
Its the opposite.

What i have experimented with so far:

Supervised Learning:

    Linear Regression
  
    Logistic Regression
  
    K-Nearest Neighbors
        
        K-Nearest Neighbors is an algorithm that (for a 1 dimensional dataset) observes the k closest x values from x* and averages their corresponding y values to predict a new y vlaue for x*.

    Neural Networks
  
  
Unsupervised Learning:

    K-Means Clustering
  
    Principle Component Analysis
